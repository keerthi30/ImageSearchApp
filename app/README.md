This is  a Sample app to load the list of images when user searches by specific tag. Clicking on the done button from keyboard will do a search.

These Are the below Libraries that i used for this exercise:
I used Retrofit to make Api Call.
I used Gson libraries to convert JSON data to Objects.
I Used Koin for the dependency Management.
I have Utilized Jetpack Compose for Rendering UI and for Navigation
I intend to use Room database to save the User search tag list.
